\title{Generate seed as a integer vector}
\usage{
generateSeedVectors(n, bits = 64)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer scalar, number of seeds to generate.}

\item{bits}{Integer scalar, number of bits to store per seed. This
must be a multiple of 32.}
}
\value{
A list of length \code{n}, where each element is an integer vector that
contains \code{bits} bits of randomness across all elements.
}
\description{
Generate seed as a integer vector
}
\details{
Each seed is encoded as an integer vector with the most significant bits
at the start of the vector. Each integer vector is converted into an
unsigned integer (in C++ or otherwise) by the following procedure:
\enumerate{
\item Start with a sum of zero.
\item Add the first value of the vector.
\item Left-shift the sum by 32.
\item Add the next value of the vector, and repeat.
}

The aim is to facilitate R-level generation of seeds with sufficient 
randomness to cover the entire state space of pseudo-random number 
generators that require more than the ~32 bits available in a typical
\code{int}. It also preserves the integer nature of the seed, thus
avoiding problems with casting double-precision numbers to integers.
